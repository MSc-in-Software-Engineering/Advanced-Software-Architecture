# Production Management System

## This subsystem contains both the Inventory management system and the Scheduling system with a C# project

The subsystem contains a Dockerfile for running the subsystem which would build and install required packages.

The subsystem would be deployed from the global docker compose file therefore no interaction is needed.

When running the system it would write status of the production of the Lego packages.
