# Production Management System

## This subsystem contains the Inventory management system with a C# project

The subsystem contains a Dockerfile for running the subsystem which would build and install required packages.

The subsystem would be deployed from the global docker compose file therefore no interaction is needed.

When running the system it would write status of the production of the Lego packages while logging the capacity of the raw bucket of materials and write the status in a database.
