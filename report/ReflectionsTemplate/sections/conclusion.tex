\section{Conclusion}
During the project, the workload of both the report writing and the system development was equally divided. The work was done in an agile manner where each member had their own responsibility and tasks during the project development. Every task was completed successfully which made the team able to complete the project within the defined schedule initiated. The group managed to develop an architecture for the designated system that successfully achieved the defined quality attributes. The stated problem was resolved while the executed experiment evaluated the proposed quality attribute which was performance. The experiment was intended to evaluate and test the interoperability of the architecture; however, the collected results described the performance quality attribute greater. Therefore, the experiment does not evaluate upon additional quality attributes due to a lack of time for establishing new experiments, which could be conducted for future work. To conclude upon the overall project development, it was successfully initialised, managed and executed whereas the objective, problem, and research questions were examined and answered in depth.
