\section{Contribution}
The workload throughout the project has been equally distributed amongst all the members in the group. Each section in the report were distributed, whereas the larger sections were split amongst multiple group members to be written, meanwhile the smaller sections were written by one person and assessed by another. Overall, every group member contributed equally to all the sections. Additionally, the implementation tasks for the prototype were also distributed equally in the group, where the different subsystems of the architecture got assigned to each group member, thus the group members could implement a subsystem individually. In this manner, all group members were able to contribute to the project equally, but it furthermore caused significant discussions and different insights for the project, and great teamwork to get all the systems to work together. Table \ref{tab:contributions} showcases the group members' contribution to the report:
